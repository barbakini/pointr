# Bonus Question

### Speed difference between trains 
One possible reason can be the speed difference of trains those go different directions. 

Let's say trains those go to east are faster than the ones go west, so, let's say, they get to  the final stop more than four times faster. In this scenario, there will be more trains on rails to go west than to go east. So it is acceptable that random pick for a train that goes west could be 80% chance while it is 20% chance for a train that goes east.
